# React ToDo List App

This ToDo app allows you to enter an item, name or just something you need to do and when you complete what needed to be done you are then able to view all of your completed selections.

This is a beginner todo app project using React


## Tech Stack

React, JavaScript, Components

### How To Get Started
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

Open your terminal and type:
### `npx create-react-app todo-app`

Once your code editor is opened delete the header element and everything inside of it

Then open your App.js file and click JavaScript at the bottom. Type in React and select JavaScript React. In order to make sure your JSX works.

Delete the svg file under the src folder.
Delete the import svg in the App.js file.
Delete the App.test.js file under the src folder
Delete all of the code in App.css

## You are ready to code!!

You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
